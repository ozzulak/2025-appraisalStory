# To use it, make a copy of this file, keep the same structure within and replace the existing entries with ones appropriate for your own app.

# This file uses the TOML format. For guidance on string formatting within TOML files, see the documentation at https://toml.io/
#
# The config file is specified by one of the following. If multiple options are available, the first is used:
# 1. Run the app with `streamlit run first_prototype.py path-to-file/config-file-name.toml`
# 2. Add the line `CONFIG_FILE = 'path-to-file/config-file-name.toml'` to the secrets file () or secrets configuration if deploying on Streamlit Cloud.
#   Run the app with `streamlit run first_prototype.py`.
# 3. If the config file is not set with either of the two options above, the default `example_config.toml` file is used.

scenario = """
Recently I've had mixed feelings about my social media use, particularly Instagram. \
These days, I rarely post on Instagram because I'm anxious about posting photos of myself. \
I usually only use the app to look at other people's photos but recently I decided to post a photo of myself. \
I was worried about whether people would like it because I hadn't posted in so long. \
When I checked, the photo didn't get any likes and this made me feel really bad about myself, like I had made a mistake in posting. \
I got so anxious about it that I ended up deleting the app. \
I learnt my lesson and probably won't post again.
